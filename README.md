# PoorHarbor

Project developed for my Data Stuctures course at UPRM. The program is a rudimentary election system that takes a .csv file containing candidates as well as the votes casted for them and calculates a winner based on this. The purpose of this project was to learn through practice the uses of linked lists and sets.
